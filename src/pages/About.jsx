      Software Engineer from INDIA , graduating in B-Tech. 
     <br /> I believe, the only way to learn a New programming language is by writing programs in it.
     <br /> Software Engineering is not just about writing code; it's about solving problems and making lives better.
     <br />Write it. Run it. Fix it. It's not just code; it's a Lesson in persistence.
